### Tutorial to the Tutorial

This tutorial will walk you through Xcode in many different directions to make a quintessentially "simple" app, a "Tip Calculator". Every year this endeavor becomes simpler in some ways and difficult in others. You will learn about building interfaces with _auto-layout_, the majority of interfaces in _Xcode_ itself, and how to get an app running on your phone! And if you hail from a land that does not tip 15% - 20% at a restaurant, you'll technically learn about that too!

Running Time: 1 - 2 hours.


### Author's Note:

This is much more of a tutorial about Xcode then it is about programming. If you have never used an IDE before, this will get you acquainted with the minimum required knowledge to be proficient in Xcode, and even give you a taste of some of the more advanced stuff. Many times you may see multiple ways to do the same thing. But repetition is key. The authors intent here is to show you as many ways make sense in the short duration of this tutorial, so that when you are out in the wild (duck duck going for stack overflow answers) and you see a weird way of doing something, and think, hmmm... they never taught me that at Make School, well, if we did our job right, it will because thats a new feature or a 1% feature.


 A builder can only be as good as their tools, and luckily for us, Apple builds with _Xcode_ and is continuously improving it! The greatest sign of that? During the writing of this tutorial, _Xcode_ crashed exactly 0 times. When you ship your apps, that is what you need to strive for as well.


If in your learning, you ever get stuck at something Xcode and have the luxury of time, come through this tutorial again and try and follow all of the steps but none of the instructions. As Steve Jobs said, "the journey is the reward".
